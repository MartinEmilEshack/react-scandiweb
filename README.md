# React Junior Developer Test

**Hello There! human of Scandiweb..**

This is my Junior React Developer test project, which I'm really proud to have reached that far with, and can't wait to get you're feedback.

### Notes:

1. I tried to make the project architecture as close as possible as your [ScandiPWA/src](https://github.com/scandipwa/scandipwa/tree/master/packages/scandipwa/src). Maybe it would be easier to go through that way. But, I didn't feel the need for "Container Components" and I used plain `CSS` instead of `Sass`, because I don't know `Sass` yet..
2. I used `Redux` for storing global data.
3. I used `Opus` as the `GraphQL` client.
4. I added some features that just made sense like routes and `CartPage` "CHECKOUT" button without messing with the basic requirements of course.
5. The store website is flexible enough for different computer screens, but it's not responsive enough for mobile or tablet screens as that wasn't on the test requirements.
6. The "CHECKOUT" button prints the data that should be sent to the Backend in the `console` as `JSON` format.

### Again, I would love to [get your feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOuV41-a1s).

### After feedback changes..

1. All the requested changes are done.

2. Required fonts are loaded from the google fonts API. I saw it as the best and easiest option. I have never had to use non-system fonts before, so I've learned some new things and I thank you for that. I set the `font-display` behavior from the google fonts API to `swap` as I thought loading the content fast is more importnat than **only** loading them with there required style, but I would love to know your opinion.

3. Adding a product to cart from the "Products List" page defaults to the first attributes values of this product. I hope this is the required behavior.

4. Product Attributes in the "Cart" now have thier label associated with them so they have more meaning in case of "Yes" and "No" values, But I had to figure out a design. I hope It's good enough.

### Thanks again.
