# React Junior Developer Test

**Hello There! human of Scandiweb..**

This is my Junior React Developer test project, which I'm really proud to have reached that far with, and can't wait to get you're feedback.

### Notes:
1. I tried to make the project architecture as close as possible as your [ScandiPWA/src](https://github.com/scandipwa/scandipwa/tree/master/packages/scandipwa/src). Maybe it would be easier to go through that way. But, I didn't feel the need for "Container Components" and I used plain `CSS` instead of `Sass`, because I don't know `Sass` yet..
3. I used `Redux` for storing global data.
4. I have added some features that just made sense like routes and `CartPage` "CHECKOUT" button without messing with the basic requirements of course.
5. The store website is flexible enough for different computer screens, but it's not responsive enough for mobile or tablet screens as that wasn't on the test requirements.
6. The "CHECKOUT" button prints the data that chould be sent to the Backend in the `console`.

### Again, I would love to know your feedback.
